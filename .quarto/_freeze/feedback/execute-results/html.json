Please take a moment to provide your insights on the workshop. Your responses will help us improve and tailor future sessions to better meet your needs.\n\n### Feedback Questionnaire\n\nPlease rate the following statements on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is \"Strongly Disagree\" and 5 is \"Strongly Agree\":\n\n1. **The workshop objectives were clearly defined and effectively communicated.**\n   - [ ] 1\n   - [ ] 2\n   - [ ] 3\n   - [ ] 4\n   - [ ] 5\n\n2. **The workshop enhanced my understanding of the practical applications of Graph Theory in engineering and computing?**\n   - [ ] 1\n   - [ ] 2\n   - [ ] 3\n   - [ ] 4\n   - [ ] 5\n\n3. **The hands-on sessions and demonstrations using Python and NetworkX were helpful for practical learning.**\n   - [ ] 1\n   - [ ] 2\n   - [ ] 3\n   - [ ] 4\n   - [ ] 5\n\n4. **The content was well-structured, and the pace of delivery was appropriate.**\n   - [ ] 1\n   - [ ] 2\n   - [ ] 3\n   - [ ] 4\n   - [ ] 5\n\n5. **I feel more confident in applying graph-based reasoning to real-world problem-solving after attending this workshop.**\n   - [ ] 1\n   - [ ] 2\n   - [ ] 3\n   - [ ] 4\n   - [ ] 5\n\nThank you for your feedback!\n\n---\n\nYou can access the feedback form through the link below or scan the QR code to provide your responses:\n\n<https://forms.gle/AD6vuxrPoohj7iz16>\n\n\n{{< qrcode https://forms.gle/AD6vuxrPoohj7iz16 >}}\n\n\n## Response Analysis\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Load the responses data\n# Replace 'feedback_responses.csv' with the path to your feedback form responses\nresponses_df = pd.read_csv('feedback_responses.csv')\n\n# Filter numerical columns\nnumerical_columns = responses_df.select_dtypes(include=['number']).columns\nnumerical_df = responses_df[numerical_columns]\n\n#short_names = {col: f'Q{i+1}' for i, col in enumerate(numerical_df.columns)}\n# Define short names dynamically, excluding the last column\nshort_names = {col: f'Q{i+1}' for i, col in enumerate(numerical_df.columns)}\n\n# Add the last column with its original name\n#short_names[numerical_df.columns[-1]] = f'Q{len(short_names)+1}'\n\n# Ensure that the short_headings match the exact column names in your DataFrame\nnumerical_df.rename(columns=short_names, inplace=True)\n\n# Display the first few rows of the numerical dataframe to understand its structure\n#print(numerical_df.head())\n\n# Statistical summary of the numerical feedback responses\n#summary_stats = numerical_df.describe()\n\n# Calculate count, mean, and standard deviation for each numerical question\nquestion_stats = numerical_df.agg(['count', 'mean', 'std'])\n\n# Display the summary statistics and question stats\n#print(\"\\nStatistical Summary:\")\n#print(summary_stats)\n\nprint(\"\\nQuestion Statistics:\")\nprint(question_stats)\n\n# Plot distribution of responses for each numerical question\n# Plot pie charts for each numerical question\nfor question in numerical_df.columns:\n    plt.figure(figsize=(6, 5))\n    \n    # Count responses for each score\n    counts = numerical_df[question].value_counts().sort_index()\n    \n    # Plot pie chart\n    plt.pie(counts, labels=counts.index, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140, colors=plt.cm.Paired(range(len(counts))))\n    \n    plt.title(f'Pie Chart of Responses for {question}')\n    plt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie is drawn as a circle.\n    \n    # Show the plot\n    plt.show()\n\n# Plot heatmap of mean responses for numerical questions\nmean_responses = numerical_df.mean()\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 5))\nsns.heatmap(mean_responses.values.reshape(-1, 1), annot=True, fmt='.2f', yticklabels=numerical_df.columns, cmap='coolwarm', cbar=True)\nplt.title('Mean Responses Heatmap')\nplt.xlabel('Mean Score')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n",
