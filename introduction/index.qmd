## Module 1: Applications of Graph Theory in Engineering & Emerging Technologies

## Introduction

Graph Theory forms a foundational pillar across modern Computer Science and Engineering. 
From the historic *Königsberg Bridge Problem* raised by Leonhard Euler in 1736 to today’s 
cutting-edge applications in **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Cyber-security, 
VLSI, IoT, Intelligent Transportation, and Social Network Analytics**, graph structures 
provide a natural mathematical way to represent relationships, connectivity, and optimization.

This session is designed to bridge the gap between **Discrete Mathematics** and **real-world 
engineering applications**, demonstrating how mathematical graph concepts translate into 
practical computational tools.


## Learning Objectives

At the end of this session, participants will be able to:

- Understand the evolution of graph theory from classical problems to modern computational applications.
- Model real scenarios as graphs and analyze connectivity, traversal, and optimization.
- Explore graph algorithms implemented through simulation and programming.
- Recognize the role of graph theory in AI, ML, and data-driven intelligent systems.
- Develop intuition for advanced concepts such as graph coloring, network flows, and spectral graph theory.


This module introduces the historical evolution of graph theory, beginning with the classical foundations laid by *Leonhard Euler (1736)*, and follows its transformation into a cornerstone of modern engineering and computational technologies.

## Historical Starting Point: The Königsberg Bridges Problem

The earliest known problem leading to graph theory originated from the city of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia), divided by the river Pregel with *seven bridges* linking different land masses. Citizens wondered:

> *Is there a walk through the city that crosses each bridge exactly once?*

Euler abstracted the problem by representing landmasses as *vertices* and bridges as *edges*, forming the world’s first mathematical graph.

### Euler’s Key Result

A connected graph admits an *Eulerian circuit* if and only if *every vertex has even degree*.  

General case: A graph contains an *Eulerian path* if exactly *0 or 2 vertices have odd degree*.

Euler’s solution marks the birth of **topological graph theory** and the first example of modelling reality with abstraction.

## Development Through the 19th & 20th Centuries

|------|------------|--------------|
| 1847 | Gustav Kirchhoff | Electrical network theory & spanning trees in circuits |
| 1857 | Arthur Cayley | Counting labelled trees, chemical molecular structures |
| 1913 | George D. Birkhoff | Chromatic polynomial & map colouring |
| 1936 | Kuratowski | Characterization of planar graphs |

## Evolution from Mathematical Theory to Engineering

Graph theory transitioned from pure mathematics to an essential tool for computation and real-world problem solving. Today, nearly every complex engineering system is modelled using graph structures.

### Why Engineers Need Graph Theory

Graphs enable engineers to **analyze**, **optimize**, and **predict** system behavior.

| Domain | Engineering Problem | Graph Concept | Algorithmic Tool |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Computer Networks | Packet routing, topology design | Weighted graphs | Dijkstra / Bellman–Ford |
| Artificial Intelligence | Knowledge graphs, reasoning, GNNs | Directed labelled graphs | PageRank, embeddings |
| VLSI & CAD | Circuit layout & track minimisation | Graph colouring | Greedy, planar colouring |
| Transport & Robotics | Navigation, path planning | Shortest paths | A*, BFS |
| Cybersecurity | Attack spread modelling | Attack graphs | Centrality |
| Social Networks | Influence, community detection | Small-world graphs | Modularity, clustering |
| Big Data | Large-scale graph analytics | Distributed graphs | MapReduce / Spark GraphX |
| Healthcare | Disease spread & medical networks | Dynamic graphs | SIR modelling |


## Key Ideas That Form the Foundations of Graph Algorithms

- **Traversal:** BFS, DFS for exploring nodes and connectivity
- **Optimisation:** Minimal spanning trees, flows, cut problems
- **Ranking & Influence:** Centrality, PageRank
- **Scheduling & Resources:** Graph colouring
- **Structure Discovery:** Communities & clustering
- **Learning:** GNNs for relational intelligence

Mathematically, a graph is defined as:

$$ G = (V, E) $$
where  
- $V$ is a set of **vertices**,  
- $E$ is a set of **edges** connecting pairs of vertices.

## Demonstration: Representing Reality through Graph Abstraction

```{python}
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from([("Island 1","Island 2"),("Island 1","Island 3"),
                  ("Island 2","Island 3"),("Island 3","Island 4"),
                  ("Island 4","Island 1")])
nx.draw(G, with_labels=True)
plt.show()
```

## Conclusion

Graph Theory evolved from Euler’s solution to a historic puzzle into a powerful computational language for solving real-world problems. It now forms the mathematical backbone of modern engineering systems — from internet routing and GPS navigation to web search engines, cybersecurity, and intelligent AI models such as Graph Neural Networks.
