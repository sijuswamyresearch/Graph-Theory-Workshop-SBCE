Students will learn to construct real and simulated graphs, visualize structure, compute metrics, and explore algorithms such as *shortest paths, centrality, and colouring*.  \n\nThe objective is to bridge theoretical understanding from discrete mathematics to real-world implementations in engineering problems such as *network routing, urban mobility, scheduling, and social network analytics*.\n\n## Module Objectives\n\nAfter completing this module, students are expected to be able to:\n\n- Construct graphs from real-world datasets\n- Apply algorithms for shortest paths, spanning trees, and colouring\n- Analyse networks using centrality measures\n- Perform visual and interpretative data-driven studies\n\n",
