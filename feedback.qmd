## Response Analysis

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the responses data
# Replace 'feedback_responses.csv' with the path to your feedback form responses
responses_df = pd.read_csv('feedback_responses.csv')

# Filter numerical columns
numerical_columns = responses_df.select_dtypes(include=['number']).columns
numerical_df = responses_df[numerical_columns]

#short_names = {col: f'Q{i+1}' for i, col in enumerate(numerical_df.columns)}
# Define short names dynamically, excluding the last column
short_names = {col: f'Q{i+1}' for i, col in enumerate(numerical_df.columns)}

# Add the last column with its original name
#short_names[numerical_df.columns[-1]] = f'Q{len(short_names)+1}'

# Ensure that the short_headings match the exact column names in your DataFrame
numerical_df.rename(columns=short_names, inplace=True)

# Display the first few rows of the numerical dataframe to understand its structure
#print(numerical_df.head())

# Statistical summary of the numerical feedback responses
#summary_stats = numerical_df.describe()

# Calculate count, mean, and standard deviation for each numerical question
question_stats = numerical_df.agg(['count', 'mean', 'std'])

# Display the summary statistics and question stats
#print("\nStatistical Summary:")
#print(summary_stats)

print("\nQuestion Statistics:")
print(question_stats)

# Plot distribution of responses for each numerical question
# Plot pie charts for each numerical question
for question in numerical_df.columns:
    plt.figure(figsize=(6, 5))
    
    # Count responses for each score
    counts = numerical_df[question].value_counts().sort_index()
    
    # Plot pie chart
    plt.pie(counts, labels=counts.index, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140, colors=plt.cm.Paired(range(len(counts))))
    
    plt.title(f'Pie Chart of Responses for {question}')
    plt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie is drawn as a circle.
    
    # Show the plot
    plt.show()

# Plot heatmap of mean responses for numerical questions
mean_responses = numerical_df.mean()
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 5))
sns.heatmap(mean_responses.values.reshape(-1, 1), annot=True, fmt='.2f', yticklabels=numerical_df.columns, cmap='coolwarm', cbar=True)
plt.title('Mean Responses Heatmap')
plt.xlabel('Mean Score')
plt.show()
