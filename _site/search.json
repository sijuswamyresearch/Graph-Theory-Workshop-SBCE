    "text": "Introduction\nGraphs play an increasingly critical role in modern Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, enabling representation and reasoning over structured data with complex relationships. Unlike traditional ML models that handle grid-structured or tabular data, graphs naturally encode interconnected, relational and irregular structures.\nThe development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), has opened new avenues for learning from structured dependencies rather than treating data points as independent entities. These models have demonstrated breakthrough performance in tasks such as node classification, link prediction, community detection, recommendation systems, and risk intelligence.\nFurthermore, real-world AI systems—such as Google’s ranking algorithms, fraud detection engines in banking, medical knowledge discovery systems, and smart city analytics—rely heavily on graph-based reasoning. As industry adoption accelerates, expertise in graph analytics and graph-based deep learning has become an essential skill for engineers, data scientists, and AI researchers.\nGraph-based approaches thus represent a powerful paradigm shift: from learning on isolated data points to learning from connected knowledge.\nMastering graph theory and graph ML prepares learners to solve scalable real-world problems and engage in research opportunities at the intersection of mathematics, computation, and intelligent systems.\nThis module introduces core graph-based AI models and algorithms: - Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for semantic reasoning and information organization - PageRank algorithm for ranking & recommendation - Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for deep learning on graph-structured data",

    "text": "Introduction\nGraphs play an increasingly critical role in modern Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, enabling representation and reasoning over structured data with complex relationships. Unlike traditional ML models that handle grid-structured or tabular data, graphs naturally encode interconnected, relational and irregular structures.\nThe development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), has opened new avenues for learning from structured dependencies rather than treating data points as independent entities. These models have demonstrated breakthrough performance in tasks such as node classification, link prediction, community detection, recommendation systems, and risk intelligence.\nFurthermore, real-world AI systems—such as Google’s ranking algorithms, fraud detection engines in banking, medical knowledge discovery systems, and smart city analytics—rely heavily on graph-based reasoning. As industry adoption accelerates, expertise in graph analytics and graph-based deep learning has become an essential skill for engineers, data scientists, and AI researchers.\nGraph-based approaches thus represent a powerful paradigm shift: from learning on isolated data points to learning from connected knowledge.\nMastering graph theory and graph ML prepares learners to solve scalable real-world problems and engage in research opportunities at the intersection of mathematics, computation, and intelligent systems.\nThis module introduces core graph-based AI models and algorithms: - Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for semantic reasoning and information organization - PageRank algorithm for ranking & recommendation - Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for deep learning on graph-structured data"

Unlike rule-based learning, which relies on predefined rules and logic to make decisions, machine learning algorithms dynamically adapt and learn from patterns within data. This enables them to handle complex and variable inputs without explicit programming for every scenario. Essentially, machine learning is a richer computational translation of mathematical and statistical models, allowing for more flexible and accurate predictions by identifying patterns and insights that rule-based systems might overlook. A wonderful aspect of machine learning is its ability to store the learned patterns and knowledge, allowing models to be reused and refined over time for future predictions, thereby continuously enhancing their performance as more data becomes available.\nThe Classification of Machine Learning Algorithms is shown below.",

Citizens wondered:\n\nIs there a walk through the city that crosses each bridge exactly once?\n\nEuler abstracted the problem by representing landmasses as vertices and bridges as edges, forming the world’s first mathematical graph.\n\nEuler’s Key Result\nA connected graph admits an Eulerian circuit if and only if every vertex has even degree.\nGeneral case: A graph contains an Eulerian path if exactly 0 or 2 vertices have odd degree.\nEuler’s solution marks the birth of topological graph theory and the first example of modelling reality with abstraction.",

    "text": "Conclusion\nGraph Theory evolved from Euler’s solution to a historic puzzle into a powerful computational language for solving real-world problems. It now forms the mathematical backbone of modern engineering systems — from internet routing and GPS navigation to web search engines, cybersecurity, and intelligent AI models such as Graph Neural Networks.\n\nGraph Theory connects mathematical reasoning with engineering innovation, transforming abstract structures into practical solutions.",
