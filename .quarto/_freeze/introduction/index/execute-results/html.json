Citizens wondered:\n\n> *Is there a walk through the city that crosses each bridge exactly once?*\n\nEuler abstracted the problem by representing landmasses as *vertices* and bridges as *edges*, forming the world’s first mathematical graph.\n\n### Euler’s Key Result\n\nA connected graph admits an *Eulerian circuit* if and only if *every vertex has even degree*.  \n\nGeneral case: A graph contains an *Eulerian path* if exactly *0 or 2 vertices have odd degree*.\n\nEuler’s solution marks the birth of **topological graph theory** and the first example of modelling reality with abstraction.\n\n## Development Through the 19th & 20th Centuries\n\n| Year | Contributor | Contribution |\n|------|------------|--------------|\n| 1847 | Gustav Kirchhoff | Electrical network theory & spanning trees in circuits |\n| 1857 | Arthur Cayley | Counting labelled trees, chemical molecular structures |\n| 1913 | George D.

Today, nearly every complex engineering system is modelled using graph structures.\n\n### Why Engineers Need Graph Theory\n\nGraphs enable engineers to **analyze**, **optimize**, and **predict** system behavior.\n\n| Domain | Engineering Problem | Graph Concept | Algorithmic Tool |\n|--------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Computer Networks | Packet routing, topology design | Weighted graphs | Dijkstra / Bellman–Ford |\n| Artificial Intelligence | Knowledge graphs, reasoning, GNNs | Directed labelled graphs | PageRank, embeddings |\n| VLSI & CAD | Circuit layout & track minimisation | Graph colouring | Greedy, planar colouring |\n| Transport & Robotics | Navigation, path planning | Shortest paths | A*, BFS |\n| Cybersecurity | Attack spread modelling | Attack graphs | Centrality |\n| Social Networks | Influence, community detection | Small-world graphs | Modularity, clustering |\n| Big Data | Large-scale graph analytics | Distributed graphs | MapReduce / Spark GraphX |\n| Healthcare | Disease spread & medical networks | Dynamic graphs | SIR modelling |\n\n\n## Key Ideas That Form the Foundations of Graph Algorithms\n\n- **Traversal:** BFS, DFS for exploring nodes and connectivity\n- **Optimisation:** Minimal spanning trees, flows, cut problems\n- **Ranking & Influence:** Centrality, PageRank\n- **Scheduling & Resources:** Graph colouring\n- **Structure Discovery:** Communities & clustering\n- **Learning:** GNNs for relational intelligence\n\nMathematically, a graph is defined as:\n\n$$ G = (V, E) $$\nwhere  \n- $V$ is a set of **vertices**,  \n- $E$ is a set of **edges** connecting pairs of vertices.\n\n---\n\n## Demonstration: Representing Reality through Graph Abstraction\n\n::: {#b8075316 .cell execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-revealjs/cell-2-output-1.png){width=979 height=499}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGraph Theory evolved from Euler’s solution to a historic puzzle into a powerful computational language for solving real-world problems. It now forms the mathematical backbone of modern engineering systems — from internet routing and GPS navigation to web search engines, cybersecurity, and intelligent AI models such as Graph Neural Networks.\n\n> Graph Theory connects mathematical reasoning with engineering innovation, transforming abstract structures into practical solutions.\n\n",
